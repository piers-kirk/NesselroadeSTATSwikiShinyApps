FOR NEXT WEEK:
create R Shiny app that uses 1 distribution, 
include pop values, sample size and number of samples 


To Dos
the app should show sampling from non-normal distributions in addition 
to normal distribution + plotting should include sample means as opposed to normal 
functions to consider: rnorm - see documentation: 
lambda - per unit time what is the average amount of occurrences that you think will happen
http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/old/5101/rlook.html 
binomial ( 2 ) , normal ( 2 ) , poisson ( 1 ) , uniform ( 2 )  
use the r functions 

drop-down of chosen distribution 
something to enter parameters of pop distribution 
sample size and number of samples using slide bar (sample size [e.g. 30] vs. number of samples [how many data points])
display 
mean, variance 
overlay theoretical normal distribution function 

For next week: 
using base R 
takes a sample from a normal distribution
show that the sample means also follow a normal distribution.

Mean of sample distribution = mu
variance of sample distribution = var/sample size
Sigma/sample size
